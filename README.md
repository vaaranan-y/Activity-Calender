# Activity Calender
## Overview
Families or organisations with people in their care with learning disabilities/autism will use a visual symbol calendar which communicates to the individual what activities they will participate in that week, which carer/support worker is supporting them, and what form of transport they will take. It can be essential for anyone with learning difficulties to have this communicated non verbally.

We therefore have digitise this into a desktop app, which eliminates the upkeep of paper symbols, provides a rich interface for carers/support workers and the individual to interact can with a more modernized approach.
